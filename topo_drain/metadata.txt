description=A QGIS plugin for planning surface drainage water management. It automates the extraction of main valleys and ridges, and supports various other water retention planning methods, such as Keyline Design (keypoints, keylines), pond siting and various other sponge-scape measures. The algorithms are mainly based on WhiteboxTools. The plugin will be developed further on a regular basis.

about=A QGIS plugin for planning surface-drainage water management. It automates the extraction of main valleys and ridges and supports various water-retention planning methods—such as Keyline Design (keypoints, keylines), pond siting, and other sponge-scape measures. The plugin will be developed further on a regular basis. Core algorithms leverage WhiteboxTools (Lindsay, 2017–2020; see https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools).
