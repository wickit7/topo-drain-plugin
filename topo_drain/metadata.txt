description=A QGIS plugin for planning surface drainage water management - i.e. Keyline-Design.
version=0.1.1
author=Timo Wicki
email=wickitimo@gmail.com
about=It automates the extraction of main valleys and ridges, creates off-contour line and supports various water-retention planning methods—such as Keyline Design. The tool can also be used for other tasks, such as planning the location and alignment of paths and roads.
    Influencing surface runoff on land is complex and requires significant expertise. This tool is intended as an aid for users with experience in land surface water management.
    
    Core algorithms leverage WhiteboxTools (Lindsay, 2017–2020; see https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools).
    So make shure you have installed and configured the plugin "WhiteboxTools for QGIS" (i.e. see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXDBsNbcTg).
    
    This plugin requires several Python packages (numpy, rasterio, shapely, geopandas, scipy). These are NOT always included in the default QGIS Python environment.
    For help installing Python packages in QGIS, see:
    - Windows: https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/installing-python-packages-in-qgis-3-for-windows/
    - macOS: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/351280/installing-python-modules-for-qgis-3-on-mac
    or use QGIS Plugin "QGIS Pip Manager" for installing the python packages.

    A series of manual videos will follow soon: How to install a plugin with dependencies; how to use the tool, i.e. how to create a keyline design.

    The plugin will be developed further on a regular basis.
