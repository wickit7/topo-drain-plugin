name=TopoDrain
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=A QGIS plugin for planning surface drainage water management like Keyline-Design.
version=1.0.1
author=Timo Wicki
email=wickitimo@gmail.com
about=It automates the extraction of main valleys and ridges, creates off-contour line and supports creating Keyline Designs and other water-retention planning measures. The tool can also be used for other tasks, such as planning the location and alignment of paths and roads.
    DISCLAIMER: Influencing surface runoff on land is complex and requires significant expertise. This tool is intended as an aid for users with experience in land surface water management.
    
    DOCUMENTATION: Detailed INSTALLATION MANUAL and TUTORIAL GUIDES are available on the project homepage: https://github.com/wickit7/topo-drain-plugin
    
    Core algorithms leverage WhiteboxTools (Lindsay, 2017–2020; see https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools).
    So make shure you have installed and configured the plugin "WhiteboxTools for QGIS"!
    - Installation video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJXDBsNbcTg
    
    This plugin requires several Python packages (numpy, shapely, pandas, geopandas, scipy).
    These packages are widely used in geospatial data processing, but may not all are included in default QGIS installations (pandas, geopandas, and scipy). If a package is missing, follow the installation instructions below:
    - Windows, QGIS installed with OSGeo4W: https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/installing-python-packages-in-qgis-3-for-windows/
    - macOS (terminal): https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/351280/installing-python-modules-for-qgis-3-on-mac
